# Spot
A web app that will calculate uptime for a given site(s)

The idea for the project is based off of a dog. A dog will continually dig, fetch and bark at your sites to validate it's integrity.

### Fetch

The application will periodically check your site and return the response code of your site. If the response code is not satisfactory, it is logged as a fetch result. 

### Dig

Currently not built. The app will monitor your API endpoints to validate the integrity of the data.

### Bark

Currently not built. The app, after x consecutive fails, will notify users that their site has issues.
